# Quiz Application

This Quiz Application is a full-stack web application built with React and Node.js. It features a dynamic quiz interface that pulls questions from a backend server, evaluates responses, and generates personalized feedback for users based on their performance.

## Features

- Dynamic quiz generation from server-side data.
- Real-time feedback based on user answers, with detailed explanations and scoring.
- Responsive design for optimal user experience on desktop and mobile devices.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to install the software and how to install them:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com/))
- Git (Optional, if you want to clone the repository)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

#### Cloning the Repository (Optional)

If you've placed this project in a Git repository, start by cloning the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saatv1k/AiQuizApp.git
cd quiz-app-max_pense-saatvik_singaraju
```
### Setting Up the API Key
Open up the .env file and input your API Key


#### Setting Up the Backend

Install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the server:

node index.js

This will start the backend server on `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Setting Up the Frontend

Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory from the project root:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the frontend on `http://localhost:3001` and should automatically open in your default web browser. If it doesn't, you can manually open it by visiting the URL.

## Usage

Once both servers are running, navigate to `http://localhost:3001` in your web browser to start using the application. You will be presented with a quiz that you can complete and submit to receive feedback based on your answers.
